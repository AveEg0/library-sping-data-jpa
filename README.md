It is my old project 'library' but with using Spring Data JPA and with some adding features like search page,
pagenation and sorting in index page for books using request params, adding new field 'taken_at' to book entity and expiration for it, also some minor changing.
But main purpose is transfer project to new type of data base interaction through Spring Data JPA.
